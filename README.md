# kingscounty-housingmodel
I was tasked with building a model to predict house sale prices for Washingtonâ€™s Kings County, which includes the city of Seattle. To build this model, I investigated the KC_House_Sales dataset, which contains information about homes sold in Kings County between May 2014 and May 2015, including their final sale price in US Dollars.
